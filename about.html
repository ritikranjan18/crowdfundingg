                <h2>Revolutionizing Fundraising Through Trust and Transparency</h2>
                <p>The Crowdfunding is an online money-raising strategy that began as a way for the public to donate small amounts of money to help creative people finance their projects.
                    Through crowdfunding, individuals are able to invest in entrepreneurial start-ups using an intermediary agency like a broker or dealer. 
                    problem with the current sites is that they donâ€™t provide a donor guarantee policy and they do not have control over the money they donated.
                    Our Trusted Crowd-Funding Platform is a solution to these issues of the previous system. It uses smart contract technology to develop a trusted Crowd-Funding platform.
